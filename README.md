# Selenium Webscraper 

```
Please note that this code is for study and cataloging purposes only 
and will not work without a paid account for the website.

## Goal
Create a catalog of Yoga and Meditation videos, based on the AloMoves website. 

## Challenge
The information to be scrapped loads with javascript and is behind a login wall.

## Solution
Using Selenium library, I created a script that takes the course's main url as input and saves the tree of content in that url to a json. 

## Learnings
1. Scrapping web content is fun
2. Once you understand the structure of the content (how it loads, what is located where) it's pretty straight forward
